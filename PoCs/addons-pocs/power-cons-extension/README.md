# T6 - Power Consumption Extension

Extension that measures the total power consumption as sum of the value of the `instantaneousPower` property.
The `Reset` button will **temporarily** alter the `instantaneousPower` property, setting it to 0.

Tested on a custom version of `virtual-things-adapter`.
