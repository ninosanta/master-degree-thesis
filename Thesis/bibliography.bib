    abstract = {Abstract Industrial control systems (ICSs) used to be operated in closed networks, that is, separated physically from the Internet and corporate networks, and independent protocols were used for each manufacturer. Thus, their operation was relatively safe from cyberattacks. However, with advances in recent technologies, such as big data and internet of things, companies have been trying to use data generated from the ICS environment to improve production yield and minimize process downtime. Thus, ICSs are being connected to the internet or corporate networks. These changes have increased the frequency of attacks on ICSs. Despite this increased cybersecurity risk, research on ICS security remains insufficient. In this paper, we analyze threats in detail using STRIDE threat analysis modeling and DREAD evaluation for distributed control systems, a type of ICSs, based on our work experience as cybersecurity specialists at a refinery. Furthermore, we verify the validity of threats identified using STRIDE through case studies of major ICS cybersecurity incidents: Stuxnet, BlackEnergy 3, and Triton. Finally, we present countermeasures and strategies to improve risk assessment of identified threats.},

pages="347--363",
abstract="In an initial attempt to systematize the research field of architectural threat analysis, this paper presents a comparative study of two threat analysis techniques. In particular, the controlled experiment presented here compares two variants of Microsoft's STRIDE. The two variants differ in the way the analysis is performed. In one case, each component of the software system is considered in isolation and scrutinized for potential security threats. In the other case, the analysis has a wider scope and considers the security threats that might occur in a pair of interacting software components. The study compares the techniques with respect to their effectiveness in finding security threats (benefits) as well as the time that it takes to perform the analysis (cost). We also look into other human aspects which are important for industrial adoption, like, for instance, the perceived difficulty in learning and applying the techniques as well as the overall preference of our experimental participants.",

abstract = {Architectural threat analysis has become an important cornerstone for organizations concerned with developing secure software. Due to the large number of existing techniques it is becoming more challenging for practitioners to select an appropriate threat analysis technique. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of the existing techniques for threat analysis. In our study we compare 26 methodologies for what concerns their applicability, characteristics of the required input for analysis, characteristics of analysis procedure, characteristics of analysis outcomes and ease of adoption. We also provide insight into the obstacles for adopting the existing approaches and discuss the current state of their adoption in software engineering trends (e.g. Agile, DevOps, etc.). As a summary of our findings we have observed that: the analysis procedure is not precisely defined, there is a lack of quality assurance of analysis outcomes and tool support and validation are limited.}

% % An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
% % settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
% % before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
% % (just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
% % in the bibliography.)
% % The available control fields are:
% %
% % CTLuse_article_number
% % "no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
% % "yes" enables
% %
% % CTLuse_paper
% % "no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
% % "yes" enables
% %
% % CTLuse_forced_etal
% % "no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
% % "yes" enables
% %
% % CTLmax_names_forced_etal
% % The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
% % usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
% % is not greater than this value!
% %
% % CTLnames_show_etal
% % The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
% % Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal
% %
% % CTLuse_alt_spacing
% % "no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
% % "yes" enables
% %
% % CTLalt_stretch_factor
% % If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
% % the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
% % default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
% % stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.
% %
% % CTLdash_repeated_names
% % "no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
% % of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
% % "yes" enables
% %
% % CTLname_format_string
% % The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
% % guide.
% % IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,
% %
% % CTL_name_latex_cmd
% % A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
% % Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
% % The default is empty.
% %
% % Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out or empty.
